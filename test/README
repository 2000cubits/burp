IMPORTANT: Run the script 'test_self' whilst standing in the same directory as
the script.

It will copy the source from the parent directory into 'build', and then
install it into 'target'.

It will then run through some basic tests, running the server and client on
the same machine.



WINDOWS TEST NOT QUITE WORKING YET.

To run an automatic test of Windows, you need to set up cygwin on your Windows
machine, and it needs to be a recent update of cygwin. I got it working with
the 2013-01-11 snapshot. You need to setup automatic log in via ssh to the
Windows machine. If your cygwin isn't new enough, the automatic log in will
not have all the privileges needed to install the Windows client.

Be aware that the automatic Windows test will delete any existing burp
installation.
