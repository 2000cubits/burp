Things to watch out for when upgrading.
1.3.3
-----
If installing with 'make install' and you want to use the 'initialise manual
backup from server' feature, you will need to replace /etc/burp/timer_script
with configs/server/timer_script from the source, because 'make install' will
not overwrite the old version.

1.3.2
-----
The process of generating SSL certificates has been automated, so the old
default keys and certificates have been removed from new installs.
See docs/burp_ca.txt for more information.

1.3.1
-----
Due to Debian policy, burp and bedup will now be installed in /usr/sbin.
Therefore, you may need to update any cron jobs that were previously using
/sbin.

1.2.4
-----
There was a critical bug in 1.2.4.
Please upgrade clients and servers to 1.2.5 as soon as you can.

1.1.x to 1.2.0
---------------
* Clients on 1.1.70 or older will not work with a 1.2.0 server. You will need
to upgrade the clients at the same time. Your old backups will continue to
work.
* If you previously compiled with './configure --prefix=/usr', you will probably
now want to compile with just './configure'. The binary will now go to
/sbin/burp, with a symlink from /usr/sbin/burp.
* If you are installing from source onto the server, you may want to
'rm /etc/burp/notify_script' before 'make installation', otherwise you won't
get the updated version.
