Things to watch out for when upgrading.

2.0.6
-----
Warning about hardlinked_archive in burp1 style backups:
In this version, I have changed the way that hardlinked_archive works slightly,
in order to fix https://github.com/grke/burp/issues/176 - unnecessary
duplication and deletion.
In the past, the previous current backup would have a file called 'hardlinked'
created when the next backup was being finalised. So, the decision was being
made during the next backup.
Now, the decision is being made for each backup when it is being finalised
itself (rather than waiting for the next one).
This means that, when you upgrade, your most recent backup will look like a
non-hardlinked_archive, and when you make you next burp1 style backup with a
2.0.x server, it will treat the previous backup as a non-hardlinked_archive.
If you need it to be a hardlinked_archive, make sure that you anticipate this
before the next backup happens, by creating a file called something like:
/var/spool/burp/<client>/current/hardlinked

2.0.4
-----
There has been a massive rewrite of most of burp.

The intention is that burp1 clients will continue to work with burp2
servers.
Burp2 clients can also be configured to work in burp1 mode. See the 'protocol'
option in the man page and example config files.
Burp2 code is capable of doing variable length chunking for inline
deduplication, with sparse indexing on the server side.

Use this version with extreme caution.
Burp2 is currently missing some features, such as acl/xattr, Windows EFS,
encryption and compression support.
The burp1 protocol should still work with these features, but be careful.
The status monitor is also not working. 
Due to the extent of the rewrite, pretty much anything may not working
correctly.
Do not expect burp2, and the backups that it makes, to be compatible
with future releases of burp2.

1.3.24
------
If installing with 'make install' and you want to use the
server_script_pre/post_notify feature, then you will probably need to overwrite
/etc/burp/notify_script by hand. The arguments to it have not changed though,
so if you do not want to use that feature, you do not need to do this.

1.3.18
------
Special care is advised when testing this release, as some of the main
structure of the program has been tweaked in order to support the stripping
out of Windows VSS information.

1.3.16
------
If you have any clients on 1.3.14, you should upgrade them to 1.3.14 due to
a bug in the exclude_comp feature.

1.3.14
------
If installing with 'make install', you will probably need to overwrite
/etc/burp/notify_script by hand.
The arguments to it have changed, so you will also need to update the
configuration in /etc/burp/burp-server.conf to be in the new style. The example
config in configs/server/burp.conf will help. 

The '-l <path>' and 'logfile = <path>' options have been removed because they
didn't work properly, and there was no sensible way to make the work properly.
There are now three settings in the conf files: stdout=[0|1], syslog=[0|1],
and progress_counters=[0|1]. If you want to see output, you may need to set
these options.

1.3.3
-----
If installing with 'make install' and you want to use the 'initialise manual
backup from server' feature, you will need to replace /etc/burp/timer_script
with configs/server/timer_script from the source, because 'make install' will
not overwrite the old version.

1.3.2
-----
The process of generating SSL certificates has been automated, so the old
default keys and certificates have been removed from new installs.
See docs/burp_ca.txt for more information.

1.3.1
-----
Due to Debian policy, burp and bedup will now be installed in /usr/sbin.
Therefore, you may need to update any cron jobs that were previously using
/sbin.

1.2.4
-----
There was a critical bug in 1.2.4.
Please upgrade clients and servers to 1.2.5 as soon as you can.

1.1.x to 1.2.0
---------------
* Clients on 1.1.70 or older will not work with a 1.2.0 server. You will need
to upgrade the clients at the same time. Your old backups will continue to
work.
* If you previously compiled with './configure --prefix=/usr', you will probably
now want to compile with just './configure'. The binary will now go to
/sbin/burp, with a symlink from /usr/sbin/burp.
* If you are installing from source onto the server, you may want to
'rm /etc/burp/notify_script' before 'make installation', otherwise you won't
get the updated version.
