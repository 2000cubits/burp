Things to watch out for when upgrading.

1.1.x to 1.2.0
---------------
* Clients older than 1.1.70 will not work with a 1.2.0 server. You will need
to upgrade the clients at the same time. Your old backups will continue to
work.
* If you previously compiled with './configure --prefix=/usr', you will probably
now want to compile with just './configure'. The binary will now go to
/sbin/burp, with a symlink from /usr/sbin/burp.
* If you are installing from source onto the server, you may want to
'rm /etc/burp/notify_script' before 'make installation', otherwise you won't
get the updated version.
