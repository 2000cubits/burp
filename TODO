The list of things to do is at:
https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

However, that is currently relating only to burp1 issues.


So, this is a list of important stuff that needs to be done for burp2,
roughly in order of most important to least.

* Check data file locks don't just make the child exit.

* Sorting the hooks at the end of a backup probably uses too much memory.

* Fix counters

* Make recovery from partially complete backups work. Hooks
  need to be generated from already transferred manifests. Need to forward
  through already written 'changed/unchanged' manifest.

* Don't store fingerprints and md5sums as strings.

* Make verify work.

* Make CMD_INTERRUPT work (on restore, maybe others too).

* Make it possible to delete unused data files.

* Make the status monitor work.

* Make the status monitor use sdirs.

* Add data compression.

* Add data encryption.

* Make acl/xattrs work as far as burp1 does.

* Make Windows EFS work.

* Make Windows 'image' backups work.

* champ_chooser: figure out a way of giving preference to newer candidates.

* Check notifications work (warnings are turned off because of conf/cntr init
  problem.
