The list of things to do is at:
https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

However, that is currently relating only to burp1 issues.


So, this is a list of important stuff that needs to be done for burp2,
roughly in order of most important to least.

* Integrate with legacy code to allow old clients to continue operating, and
  to allow new clients to operate in legacy mode.

* Get a lock before writing to a data file.

* Get a lock before regenerating a sparse index.

* Make Windows directory restores work.

* Review how the sparse indexes are generated. Probably too many of them are
  made at the moment.

* Sorting the hooks at the end of a backup probably uses too much memory.

* Separate phase1/phase2 again.

* Fix counters (needs phase1/2)

* Make recovery from partially complete backups work (needs phase1/2). Hooks
  need to be generated from already transferred manifests. Need to forward
  through already written 'changed/unchanged' manifest.

* Make include/exclude/include work again (needs phase1/2 to make it easy).
  By this, I mean including something inside a directory that is excluded.

* Don't store fingerprints and md5sums as strings.

* Make verify work.

* Make CMD_INTERRUPT work (on restore, maybe others too).

* Make it possible to delete unused data files.

* Make the status monitor work.

* Make the status monitor use sdirs.

* Add data compression.

* Add data encryption.

* Make acl/xattrs work as far as burp1 does.

* Make Windows EFS work.

* Make Windows 'image' backups work.

* Make asyncio use iobuf for everything instead of just being a wrapper around
  the old stuff.

* Make src/client/list.c use sbuf.

* champ_chooser: figure out a way of giving preference to newer candidates.

* Fix conf/cntr init problem.

* Check notifications work (warnings are turned off because of conf/cntr init
  problem.
