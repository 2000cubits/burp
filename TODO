* Investigate HFS / resource forks and make support.

* Add include/exclude wildcards.

* Run as different user/group.

* Make the restore stuff use sbuf so that I can remove the kludge from
  asyncio.c for links.

* Add xattr support.

* Add acl support.

* Add an ncurses wrapper to the monitor commands.

* Do not compress manifests and logs when compression is turned off.

* A restore warning when a file exists now seems to cause "ret OK, but zstream not finished: 0" on the server. Or does it?
