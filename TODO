The list of things to do is at:
https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

However, that is mostly relating to protocol1 issues.


So, this is a list of important stuff that needs to be done for protocol2,
roughly in order of most important to least.

* Fix counters

* Make recovery from partially complete backups work. Hooks
  need to be generated from already transferred manifests. Need to forward
  through already written 'changed/unchanged' manifest.

* Don't store fingerprints and md5sums as strings.

* Need to improve restore speed - come up with a way to efficiently read the
  blocks into memory by looking ahead in the manifests.
  maybe_copy_data_files_across() is probably broken.

* Make CMD_INTERRUPT work (on restore, maybe others too).

* Make it possible to delete unused data files.

* Make the status monitor work.

* Make the status monitor and counters use JSON.

* Add data compression.

* Add data encryption.

* Make acl/xattrs work as far as protocol1 does.

* Make Windows EFS work.

* Make Windows 'image' backups work.

* Windows directories are restoring with the wrong permissions
  - need to fix and remove 'type -f' from find command in test/test_main.

* Windows split_vss/strip_vss options cause breakage.

* champ_chooser: figure out a way of giving preference to newer candidates.
