The list of things to do is at:
https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

However, that is mostly relating to protocol1 issues.


So, this is a list of important stuff that needs to be done for protocol2,
roughly in order of most important to least.

* Rubble cleanup with working_dir_recovery_method=delete doesn't delete any
  data files.

* Need to improve restore speed - come up with a way to efficiently read the
  blocks into memory by looking ahead in the manifests.

* maybe_copy_data_files_across() is probably broken.

* Make CMD_INTERRUPT work (on restore).

* Make CMD_INTERRUPT work (on backup phase2).

* Make the status monitor work.

* Make the status monitor and counters use JSON.

* Add data compression.

* Add data encryption.

* Make acl/xattrs work as far as protocol1 does.

* Make Windows EFS work.

* Make Windows 'image' backups work.
