* Improve the byte counter:
	do something about working dir recovery

* Make SSL_shutdown() work properly.

* Investigate HFS / resource forks and make support.

* Add include/exclude wildcards.

* Think about adding a utility to create certs, like easy-rsa from OpenVPN.

* Make the restore stuff use sbuf so that I can remove the kludge from
  asyncio.c for links.

* Add xattr support.

* Add acl support.

* Improve the status monitor.

* Do not compress manifests and logs when compression is turned off.

* A restore warning when a file exists now seems to cause "ret OK, but zstream not finished: 0" on the server. Or does it?

* Allow random backups to be deleted safely when hardlinked_archive is on.

* Add extra ways of deciding when to delete old backups - e.g, by time, or
  by space.

* Add an option to set hardlinked_archive on a cycle, instead of just being
  either on or off.
