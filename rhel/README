TO BUILD:

- Download the source packages from "Source0" macros defined in the all three spec files with respective names and version numbers
  and place them in SOURCES directory.
- Run rpmbuild against each RPM:
  rpmbuild -v -ba SPECS/<filename.spec>

NOTE:

Graham says: I think that it is not necessary to build librsync and uthash, as
they are apparently available from the EPEL repository.
