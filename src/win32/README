How to build the Windows client installers on unix-based systems
----------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to get a working cross compile area set up.

Go to http://burp.grke.net/ and follow the links to download:
burp-cross-tools-mingw32-(latest.version).tar.bz2 (for 32bit clients)
burp-cross-tools-mingw64-(latest.version).tar.bz2 (for 64bit clients)

Unpack them in the same directory in which you unpacked the burp source, and
go into the directory called 'source'. Follow the instructions in the README
files.


Then you need to build the burp dependencies.

Go to http://burp.grke.net/ and follow the links to download:
burp-depkgs-mingw32-(latest.version).tar.bz2 (for 32bit clients)
burp-depkgs-mingw64-(latest.version).tar.bz2 (for 64bit clients)

Unpack them in the same directory in which you unpacked the burp source, and
go into the directory called 'source'. Follow the instructions in the README
files.

Once these have been built successfully, you can build the burp installers
themselves.

Change to the burp source directory.

Standing in src/win32, run the following:
make		(for 32bit clients)
make WIN64=yes	(for 64bit clients)

All being well, the installer file will appear in:
release32	(for 32bit clients)
release64	(for 64bit clients)
