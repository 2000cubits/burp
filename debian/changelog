  * Compilation bug solved for in farm (Closes: #659692)
  * New upstream release from GIT branch 1.3.1 on advise of author
  * Add 'exclude_fs =' option for Linux so that you can skip partitions
    types (for example, tmpfs) without generating warnings.
  * If recovery method 'resume' is set, but the includes/excludes change,
    switch to 'use', then start a new backup.
  * In the tests, check to see whether it looks like the server has finished
    the backup before moving on, rather than just waiting a set 
    amount of time.(Closes: #659462)
  * Add man pages for bedup and burp_ca.
  * Remove embedded uthash code. It will need to be installed 
    as a dependency. (Closes: #659454)
