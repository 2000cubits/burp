Some distributions (debian, ubuntu) include a uthash-dev package.
I believe that some don't (redhat, suse).
The configure script will detect if there is a uthash.h already installed
(it will probably be in /usr/include).
If there is, the installed one will be used. If there isn't, the uthash.h
included in the burp source will be used.
