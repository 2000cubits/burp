To do a bare metal restore, boot some sort of live environment that is able to
run burp.
In our case we use a 15.10 ubuntu live cd booted from the network or a usb
drive.

On the backup server
You need to rename the keys because the live cd does not have these burp keys.
On the server go to /etc/burp/CA/ and rename the keys of the host you are
going to restore.
Get the password the client used from /etc/burp/clientconfdir/clientname

On the client.
Boot your live environment. If burp is not installed install it.
Edit /etc/burp/burp.conf
Change the following items in the config:

server = 10.0.0.10 (use the ip address of your server to avoid resolving
problems)
password = get it from the backup server
cname = get it from the backup server

Determine the disk the os was running on and mount it.
In this case we mounted /dev/sda1 to /home/ubuntu/restore

mkdir /home/ubuntu/restore
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /home/ubuntu/restore

Start the restore procedure add -f if you need to overwrite files

sudo burp -a r -d /home/ubuntu/restore/

Once the restore is done you need to install grub to the boot drive to do this
we chroot into the restore directory.
Mount the critical virtual filesystems. Run the following as a single command:

for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i
/home/ubuntu/restore$i; done

Chroot into your restore system device:

sudo chroot /home/ubuntu/restore

Install GRUB 2 (substitute the correct device with the device you used
before):

grub-install /dev/sdX


If the system partitions are on a software RAID install GRUB 2 on all disks in
the RAID. Example (software RAID using /dev/sda and /dev/sdb):

grub-install /dev/sda
grub-install /dev/sdb


Recreate the GRUB 2 menu file (grub.cfg)

update-grub


Exit chroot: CTRL-D on keyboard

Reboot.

sudo reboot

On the backup server move the old keys back in place and your good to go.
