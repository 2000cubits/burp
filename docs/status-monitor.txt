WORK IN PROGRESS
WARNING - THIS WAS WRITTEN BEFORE CHANGING THE MONITOR SO THAT IT WORKS VIA
THE CLIENT.

NOTE: While the status monitor stuff also exists in burp-1, this documentation
describes the functionality as it exists in burp-2, unless otherwise stated.

Status port
-----------

On the server side, there is the ability to run a status monitor.
In the most basic sense, it is a port on which the burp server listens to
requests, and to which it outputs information.

You may use a status monitor client to connect to it, or query the port
directly.


Address and port number
-----------------------

The port that the server runs on is determined by the 'status_port' option in
/etc/burp/burp-server.conf. By default, this is 4972.
No 'status_port' option means that the burp server will not listen at all.

Burp-1 will only listen for local connections. That is, 127.0.0.1 for IPv4, or
::1 for IPv6, depending on what was chosen/available at build time (to force
IPv4, use the --disable-ipv6 configure option).

Burp-2 will listen for local connections by default. You can set the
'status_address' option in /etc/burp/burp-server.conf to explicitly choose the
listen address. This also lets you choose IPv4 or IPv6 at run time. Think
carefully before changing it, as the status port can be used to view the
contents of all backups.

Once you start the burp server, you may check the status address and port
by running a command like this:

netstat -plant | grep 4972


Built-in status monitor clients
-------------------------------

Ncurses:

This requires that burp be compiled with ncurses enabled.

Once the server is running, the ncurses status monitor client on the burp
server can be run with a command like this:

burp -c /etc/burp/burp-server -a s

You should see a list of clients along with their current status and the time
of their most recent backup.
The cursor can be moved with the arrow keys. Hitting enter or the right arrow
key will give you a list of backups for the selected client.
Choosing a backup will give you the options to browse the backup, or view
logs.
Choosing a backup that is currently in progress will also give you the option
to see live statistics.


Snapshot:

Running the following command will print a snapshot of the status monitor
status screen to stdout:

burp -c /etc/burp/burp-server -a S

One application is that a script can run this and email an administrator the
output on a cron job. This doesn't require ncurses support. There are
additional options that can be given, listed below.

       -C [client]
              Limit the output to a single client.

       -b [number]
              Show listable files in a particular backup (requires -C).

       -z [file]
              Dump a particular log file in a backup (requires -C and -b).

       -d [path]
              Show a particular path in a backup (requires -C and -b).


Other status monitor clients
----------------------------

An example of another status monitor client is burp-ui, which presents a nice
web interface.

You may, of course, telnet to the server status port and issue requests
manually. For example:
telnet 127.0.0.1 4972
or
telnet ::1 4972


Request format
--------------

Empty string
  - Request a summary of all clients.

c:<client>
  - Request the backup list of a particular client.

c:<client>:b:<backup number>
  - Request details of a particular backup.

c:<client>:b:<backup number>:l:<log type>
  - Request the contents of a log file from a backup. The available log types
    for each backup are listed with the backups themselves (above).


Response format
