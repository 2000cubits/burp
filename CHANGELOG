  * Option to prune down the number of backups kept back into the past. For
    example, keep=7 keep=4 keep=6 (on separate lines) will keep 7 daily
    backups, 4 weekly backups (7x4=28), and 6 multiples of 4 weeks (7x4x6=168).
    You can have as many 'keep' lines as you like.
  * Make sure the client version warning message appears in the backup log.

2011-09-09 Changes in burp-1.2.0:
  * Improvements to the counters and status monitor - remember the phase1
    scan counters for later phases to use for things like estimated times.
  * Add 'working_dir_recovery_method = resume' option, which continues a
    backup from the point it was interrupted.
  * Add a useful message about options when run with '-h' or '-?'.
  * Get the client to pass its version to the server. The minimum version the
    client needs to be is now this release.
  * Get the server to warn when the client is on a different version.
  * Put the number of warnings in the subject of the notification emails.
  * Allow config file location to be changed via configure (Michael Roland's
    suggestions).
  * Implement main server process config reload functionality on SIGHUP.
  * Uncomment the reload lines in the Debian init script.
  * Add logrotate file for Debian.
  * Add ability to send a regular snapshot of the status summary screen in an
	email ("daily backup summary" feature).
  * Add simple 'exclude_ext =' feature.
  * Add Windows 7 bare metal restore instructions.

2011-07-26 Changes in burp-1.1.70:
  * FreeBSD ACL support.
  * FreeBSD xattr support.
  * Handle Windows junction points.
  * Add 'nobackup = [file name]' option. If this file system entry exists, the
    directory containing it will not be backed up.
  * Set librsync signature block size based on the old file size.
  * Small bug fixes to the status monitor.
  * Fixed working directory recovery bug where it couldn't find the manifest.gz
    file due to it being called manifest.gz.tmp.
  * Get rid of the stupidly complicated 'find_files' callback mechanism
    inherited from bacula. Just call all the functions directly.
  * Fix compiler warnings and '-ldl' linker error on FreeBSD 8.2.
  * When down to 'C:' in mkpath() on Windows restore, strip the ':'.
  * Run ERR_clear_error() before SSL_read/write.

2011-06-27 Changes in burp-1.1.65:
  * Add mechanism for backing up and restoring extra meta data.

  * Linux xattr support.
  * Add option to set the umask on the server.
  * Added option to specify the clientconfdir password in passwd format.
  * Allow user and group options to be placed in the server clientconfdir files,
    so that different client backups can be owned by different users.
  * Add Patrick's burp_ca patches and README.CA.
  * Sanitised magic characters by defining them in a new cmd.h file.
  * Fixed 'ret OK, but zstream not finished: 0' when refusing to restore over
    existing files.
  * Fixed bug that made clients disappear from the status monitor.
  * Bug fix the client_lockdir option.
  * On the server, be more cautious about creating directories that don't exist.

  * Add options to run as a different user and group.
  * Add Patrick Koppen's burp_ca script.
  * Get the client restore to use the sbuf functions, remove related kludges.
  * Fix possible client segfault when refusing to restore over existing files.
  * Make a failure to restore over a busy file not cause the whole restore to
    fail.
  * Print byte count as well as human readable byte count in the status summary
    screen.
  * Include backup numbers with the backup list in the status summary.
  * Don't close the server read fd when running in non-forking mode.
  * Add ssl_key options so that the cert and key can be in separate files.
  * Add ssl_key_password, a synonym for ssl_cert_password.

2011-05-13 Changes in burp-1.1.55:
  * Make the status monitor use ncurses.
  * Fixed two bugs that could drastically slow down the server if a file
    disappeared on a client after the initial scan (to get these two bug fixes,
    you need to upgrade your clients).
  * IPv6 patches.
  * Ability to specify the location of the client lockfiles on the server.
  * Make the server fork into the background by default. Use '-F' to stay in
    the foreground.
  * Add option to specify a log file.

  * Added the ability to turn off compression.
  * Added an option to define the poll interval in the Windows installer.
  * Added the ability to turn off librsync delta differencing.
  * Added the ability to give arguments to backup/restore/pre/post scripts.

2011-04-02 Changes in burp-1.1.40:
  * Added the ability to run client pre/post backup/restore scripts.
  * Added the ability to read data from fifos (and restore to them).

    anticipation of a 'verify' command.

    IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF BURP:
    a) Your previous backups will no longer work, due to changes in the
    manifest files. You will also need to move old backups aside in order to
    continue to make new backups.
    b) Your old config files will need some fields to do with SSL added to them.
    See the man page and the examples in the 'configs' directory for help.

    IMPORTANT FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE FUTURE OF BURP:
    If you have tried burp, I really want to hear from you to find out what
    you like about it, what you don't like, what new features you would like,
    how you have been using it, whether it has helped you, or anything that
    you would like to tell me. I am currently working in the dark!

Changes in burp-1.0.31:
  * Large scale rewrites to the main backup process to make it more efficient
    and easier to understand.
  * Much tidying up of code and splitting into smaller files.
  * Removed complicated/flaky compression code from the network stuff. Network
    compression will come free with SSL anyway (when it is implemented).
    Currently, whole new files are transmitted compressed, file information
    and deltas are not.

Changes in burp-1.0.11:
  * Fixed Windows restore crash. Windows restores should now work better.

Changes in burp-1.0.10:
  * Fixed three major bugs introduced in burp-1.0.9 to do with client/server
    communication when doing deltas.
  * Make "make install" and the Windows installers not overwrite an existing
    config file.
  * Support for backup and restore of fifos and nodes.
  * KNOWN ISSUE: There seems to be a problem with restoring multiple files
    at once to Windows. I am working on this.

Changes in burp-1.0.9:
  * Added counters to summarise the files that were backed up or restored.
  * Added the ability to have warnings instead of errors always being fatal.
  * Prevent restores overwriting existing files, unless the new '-f' option is
    given.
  * Notice invalid characters in paths on Windows and replace them with
    '_'. This also means that you can now restore to alternative directories
    (the colon in the drive name no longer gets in the way).
  * Added instructions for building the Windows installer.
