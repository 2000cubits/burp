  * Fix bug where attributes on Windows directories were not getting read
    properly.
  * Fix rounding problem in remaining time estimation in the status monitor.
  * Don't backup the whole file if only ctime changed.
  * Include the client name in arguments to server scripts.
  * Do not log a message in the server SIGCHLD handler, as this appeared to
    be causing an occasional lock up on a Ubuntu server.

2011-12-30 Changes in burp-1.2.7:
  * Add an automated test script.
  * Fix bugs with uncompressed encrypted backup/restore.
  * Get verify all backups for a client (-a v -b a) to work.
  * Return non-zero if there were warnings on verify or restore.
  * Add 'min_file_size' option, fix 'max_file_size' option.
  * Add generic server-side pre/post scripts that can run on every connection
    after authentication and before disconnecting.
  * Set environment variables from SSL cert details so that the server-side
    scripts can see them.
  * Add Jason Haar's server script for doing extra SSL certificate checks.
  * Add 'max_hardlinks' option, which limits the number of times a single file
    is hardlinked in storage. Default is 10000.
  * Add '-i' option: print an index table of symbols that humans may see burp
    produce, and exit.
  * Let backups carry on when files cannot be opened.
  * Spot Windows EFS directories and files and warn about them.
  * Add an 'estimate' option (-a e), which does a scan of the file system to
    be backed up, and prints counters, without contacting the server.
  * Strip out 744 lines of unused Windows code.
  * Fix possible segfault when backup directory forward paths don't match.
  * Removed working_dir_recovery_method=merge. Use 'resume' instead.
  * Add a flexible way of passing new fields from the client to the server so
    that clients are less likely to have to upgrade.

2011-11-26 Changes in burp-1.2.5:
  * IMPORTANT: Fixed critical path comparison typo bug. If you have been using
	1.2.4 either as a server or as a client, you need to upgrade
	immediately! Backups made with 1.2.4 should be treated as suspicious.
  * Add a 'max_file_size' option.
  * Store windows file attributes in a separate field to the standard unix ones.

2011-11-22 Changes in burp-1.2.4:

    didn't previously exist.
  * Fix possible segfault when resume mode triggers with nothing to resume.

2011-09-29 Changes in burp-1.2.2:
  * Multiple retention periods (e.g, keep 1 backup per day for 7 days, 1
    backup per week for 4 weeks, 1 backup per 4 weeks for a year). See the
    'keep' option in the man page.
  * Make sure the client version warning message appears in the backup log.
  * Network send rate-limiting feature (both client and server).
  * Change pidfile paths to /var/run/burp instead of /var/lock/burp.
  * Get pre backup scripts running reliably again. Also, send script messages
    on stderr to the server backup log.
  * Fix 'Warnings' line on the status monitor.
  * Fix resume mode bug to do with potentially partially written entries at
    the end of the phase2 file.

2011-09-09 Changes in burp-1.2.0:
  * Improvements to the counters and status monitor - remember the phase1
    scan counters for later phases to use for things like estimated times.
  * Add 'working_dir_recovery_method = resume' option, which continues a
    backup from the point it was interrupted.
  * Add a useful message about options when run with '-h' or '-?'.
  * Get the client to pass its version to the server. The minimum version the
    client needs to be is now this release.
  * Get the server to warn when the client is on a different version.
  * Put the number of warnings in the subject of the notification emails.
  * Allow config file location to be changed via configure (Michael Roland's
    suggestions).
  * Implement main server process config reload functionality on SIGHUP.
  * Uncomment the reload lines in the Debian init script.
  * Add logrotate file for Debian.
  * Add ability to send a regular snapshot of the status summary screen in an
	email ("daily backup summary" feature).
  * Add simple 'exclude_ext =' feature.
  * Add Windows 7 bare metal restore instructions.

2011-07-26 Changes in burp-1.1.70:
  * FreeBSD ACL support.
  * FreeBSD xattr support.
  * Handle Windows junction points.
  * Add 'nobackup = [file name]' option. If this file system entry exists, the
    directory containing it will not be backed up.
  * Set librsync signature block size based on the old file size.
  * Small bug fixes to the status monitor.
  * Fixed working directory recovery bug where it couldn't find the manifest.gz
    file due to it being called manifest.gz.tmp.
  * Get rid of the stupidly complicated 'find_files' callback mechanism
    inherited from bacula. Just call all the functions directly.
  * Fix compiler warnings and '-ldl' linker error on FreeBSD 8.2.
  * When down to 'C:' in mkpath() on Windows restore, strip the ':'.

  * Add Patrick Koppen's burp_ca script.
  * Get the client restore to use the sbuf functions, remove related kludges.
  * Fix possible client segfault when refusing to restore over existing files.
  * Make a failure to restore over a busy file not cause the whole restore to
    fail.
  * Print byte count as well as human readable byte count in the status summary
    screen.
  * Include backup numbers with the backup list in the status summary.
  * Don't close the server read fd when running in non-forking mode.
  * Add ssl_key options so that the cert and key can be in separate files.

    you need to upgrade your clients).
  * IPv6 patches.
  * Ability to specify the location of the client lockfiles on the server.
  * Make the server fork into the background by default. Use '-F' to stay in
    the foreground.

    anticipation of a 'verify' command.

    IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF BURP:
    a) Your previous backups will no longer work, due to changes in the
    manifest files. You will also need to move old backups aside in order to
    continue to make new backups.
    b) Your old config files will need some fields to do with SSL added to them.
    See the man page and the examples in the 'configs' directory for help.

    IMPORTANT FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE FUTURE OF BURP:
    If you have tried burp, I really want to hear from you to find out what
    you like about it, what you don't like, what new features you would like,
    how you have been using it, whether it has helped you, or anything that
    you would like to tell me. I am currently working in the dark!

Changes in burp-1.0.31:
  * Large scale rewrites to the main backup process to make it more efficient
    and easier to understand.
  * Much tidying up of code and splitting into smaller files.
  * Removed complicated/flaky compression code from the network stuff. Network
    compression will come free with SSL anyway (when it is implemented).
    Currently, whole new files are transmitted compressed, file information
    and deltas are not.

Changes in burp-1.0.11:
  * Fixed Windows restore crash. Windows restores should now work better.

Changes in burp-1.0.10:
  * Fixed three major bugs introduced in burp-1.0.9 to do with client/server
    communication when doing deltas.
  * Make "make install" and the Windows installers not overwrite an existing
    config file.
  * Support for backup and restore of fifos and nodes.
  * KNOWN ISSUE: There seems to be a problem with restoring multiple files
    at once to Windows. I am working on this.

Changes in burp-1.0.9:
  * Added counters to summarise the files that were backed up or restored.
  * Added the ability to have warnings instead of errors always being fatal.
  * Prevent restores overwriting existing files, unless the new '-f' option is
    given.
  * Notice invalid characters in paths on Windows and replace them with
    '_'. This also means that you can now restore to alternative directories
    (the colon in the drive name no longer gets in the way).
  * Added instructions for building the Windows installer.
