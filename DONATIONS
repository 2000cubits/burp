Burp is open and free software. I work on it in my spare time. If you would
like this work to continue, please consider making a small donation. A
PayPal donation link and a flattr button can be found on the website
http://burp.grke.net/, along with a bitcoin address.
If you want to donate but don't like PayPal, flattr, or bitcoins, please email
me via the website contact page and we can talk about alternatives.
