Burp is a backup and restore program. It uses librsync in order to save on
the amount of space that is used by each backup. It also uses VSS (Volume
Shadow Copy Service) to make snapshots when backing up Windows computers.
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#99CCFF">
It is open source free software (where 'free' means both that you do not have
to pay for it, and that you have freedom to do what you want with it) released
under the AGPLv3 licence. See the FAQ for more information.
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#99CCFF">
Finally, as with the vast majority of open software, Burp comes with
absolutely no warranty. You are responsible for testing it and ensuring that
it works for you.
Please see the FAQ page for more information on this.

    IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF BURP:
    a) Your previous backups will no longer work, due to changes in the
    manifest files. You will also need to move old backups aside in order to
    continue to make new backups.
    b) Your old config files will need some fields to do with SSL added to them.
    See the man page and the examples in the 'configs' directory for help.

    IMPORTANT FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE FUTURE OF BURP:
    If you have tried burp, I really want to hear from you to find out what 
    you like about it, what you don't like, what new features you would like,
    how you have been using it, whether it has helped you, or anything that
    you would like to tell me. I am currently working in the dark!
