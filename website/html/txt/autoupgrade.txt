How to set up autoupgrades
--------------------------

On the client machines, you need to have fields in burp.conf that look like
this:

autoupgrade_os = win32
autoupgrade_dir = C:/Program Files/Burp/autoupgrade
or
autoupgrade_os = some_os
autoupgrade_dir = /etc/burp/autoupgrade/client

The 'os' values match a directory component on the server.
The directories given need to exist.


On the server, you need to have a field in the burp.conf that looks like this:
autoupgrade_dir = /etc/burp/autoupgrade/server

The directory needs to exist on the server.
Subdirectories need to exist for the 'autoupgrade_os' values on the client,
with further subdirectories named after the current server version.
For example:
/etc/burp/autoupgrade/server/win32/1.3.1
/etc/burp/autoupgrade/server/some_os/1.3.1

The version directory needs to contain two files called "script" and "package".


Given all the above, then when the client version is 1.2.8 or newer, and the
server version is greater than the client version, the next time the client
connects, it will download the two files, execute the "script" file, and then
exit.

Examples of "script" files are given in the source package, in
configs/server/autoupgrade.

The "package" file is the new package to be installed.



I shall explain once more, by example.

Scenario:
You have a 32 bit Windows client called 'win2k8' that is currently on 1.2.8.
You have a Debian server that is currently on 1.3.1.
You want to automatically upgrade the Windows client to 1.3.1.
You have a Windows burp installer called burp-win32-installer-1.3.1.exe.

Make sure this is in the client burp.conf file:
autoupgrade_os = win32
autoupgrade_dir = C:/Program Files/Burp/autoupgrade

Make sure this is in the server burp.conf file:
autoupgrade_dir = /etc/burp/autoupgrade/server

Make sure this directory exists on the server:
/etc/burp/autoupgrade/server/win32/1.3.1

Copy an appropriate script file to that directory (and rename it "script"):
cp burp/configs/autoupgrade/windows.script \
	/etc/burp/autoupgrade/server/win32/1.3.1/script
Copy the installer to that directory (and rename it "package"):
cp burp-win32-installer-1.3.1.exe \
	/etc/burp/autoupgrade/server/win32/1.3.1/package

The client should now automatically upgrade to 1.3.1 when it next connects.
