Windows 2008 bare metal restore steps
-------------------------------------

Unfortunately, I have not yet completed a Windows 2008 bare metal restore.
The process should be nearly identical to the Windows 7 steps, but I get stuck
at the point of making the new disk bootable.

TODO: Have another go at this. Perhaps I need to create a different version
of the WinPE disk.
