QUICK START

You need to compile burp on a unix-based operating system first.
Make sure that you have openssl, zlib and librsync libraries and development
libraries installed. With debian or ubuntu, this command should install them
for you:
apt-get install librsync-dev libz-dev libssl-dev
Change to the burp source directory and run "./configure",
then "make".
All being well, burp will compile successfully.
Then run "make install" as root to install.

Start the burp server with this command:
burp -c /etc/burp/burp-server.conf

By default, the server will fork into the background and run as a daemon. To
stay in the foreground, add the '-F' option.

UNIX CLIENT

The example client configuration file is /etc/burp/burp.conf.
It will backup /home by default.

A cron job for the client is installed to /etc/cron.d/burp and will run every
20 minutes. Whether or not this results in an actual backup depends upon the
timer settings in the server config files.

You can either force a backup by hand:
burp -a b
 
Or add a regular cron job like the following to /etc/cron.d/burp (or
equivalent). This makes the client ask the server every twenty minutes whether
it is yet time for a new backup. It is probably a good idea to change the
numbers for each client, in order to spread the load a bit:
MAILTO=
7,27,47 * * * * root    /sbin/burp -a t

WINDOWS CLIENT

Pick the 32-bit or 64-bit Burp installer as appropriate - visit
http://burp.grke.net/ to find one of them.
Compilation instructions can be found at src/win32/README in the source package.
The Windows installer will ask you for the address of your server, the client
name, and the client password. Burp will then install its files to:
C:/Program Files/Burp
If you need to change client configuration settings, the file can be found at:
C:/Program Files/Burp/burp.conf
It will be configured to backup "C:/Documents and Settings".

A Windows Scheduler task will have been installed and will be configured to
run every 20 minutes from the time of the installation. Whether or not this
results in an actual backup depends upon the timer settings in the server
config files.

To force a backup by hand, start the burp client from within its directory:
cd "C:\Program Files\Burp\bin"
burp.exe -a b
If you are running Windows 7, you might need to start the command prompt with
"Run as Administrator".



For more help, see the man page - type 'man burp'.
